# Tornado Cash. What is it?
Tornado improves transaction privacy by breaking the on-chain link between recipient and destination addresses. It uses a smart contract that accepts ETH deposits that can be withdrawn by a different address.
Tornado.cash allows you to send Ethereum cryptocurrency 100% anonymously using groundbreaking, non-custodial technology based on strong cryptography!

## How to use this tool

Please, use nodejs console. Get it using this link: https://nodejs.org/en/

### Here you can find some examples:

#### Check balance of your account

```bash
./cli.js balance <your account address> [tBTC token address] --rpc <rpc endpoint>
./cli.js balance 0x1289f5266fBad689eV1aB3e23f237f6328BAf11f 0xb752f3d8C5B7873F353C15D4ef6e151D14db69CC --rpc https://ropsten.infura.io/v3/27a9649f826b4e31a83e07ae09a87448
```

#### Deposit tBTC on Ropsten

To make a deposit user generates a secret and sends its hash (called a commitment) along with deposit amount to the Tornado smart contract. The contract accepts the deposit and adds the commitment to its list of deposits.

```bash
./cli.js deposit tBTC <amount> --rpc <rpc endpoint>
./cli.js deposit tBTC 0.001 --rpc https://ropsten.infura.io/v3/27a9649f826b4e31a83e07ae09a87448
```

#### Withdraw tBTC on Ropsten

In order to do that the user should provide a proof that he or she possesses a secret to an unspent commitment from the smart contractâ€™s list of deposits

```bash
./cli.js withdraw <note> <recipient> --rpc <rpc endpoint> --relayer <relayer endpoint>
./cli.js withdraw tornado-tbtc-0.001-3-0xbdae9a193bea274079ce3c2cfb2eede0d03ddf5aee8d069833e616a97036af0e2747cdfbde6bf87fafb17375646e9d2528c4576fe539ce1757055f30cbcc 0x1a5D6583295d56B09a4dA797275B07cC65cfC8c3 --rpc https://ropsten.infura.io/v3/27a9649f826b4e31a83e07ae09a87448 --relayer http://142.44.219.44:8000
